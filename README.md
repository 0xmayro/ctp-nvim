# Catppuccino.nvim
An eye-candy and full-featured Neovim theme with support for native LSP, Trees-sitter, and more!

## WIP
The project is under active development. Currently what is being worked on is:

+ Core
+ Integrations (Trees-sitter, native LSP, plugins (e.g. nvim-tree, lsp-saga), ...)
+ Create theme variants based on Catppuccino color palette (✅ = done; 👌 = dev; ❓ = under consideration):
	+ Dark (`catppuccino`) ✅
	+ Neon Latte (`neon_latte`) ✅
	+ Light Melya (`light_melya`) 👌
	+ Aquamarine ❓
	+ Pale ❓
	+ Nord ❓

## Sneak Peeks!
